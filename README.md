# Plants-Classification-project
# 🌱 Plant Classification using Machine Learning (Python Project)

## 📘 Project Overview
The **Plant Classification System** is a Python-based machine learning project that classifies plant species based on their visual or numerical features.  
By analyzing attributes such as leaf shape, color, texture, or image data, the model can accurately identify the plant category.  
This project demonstrates the use of **machine learning and computer vision** in agriculture and botany.


## 🎯 Objectives
- To classify plants into different species using machine learning algorithms.  
- To build a model capable of identifying plants based on features or images.  
- To support agricultural and botanical research with automated classification.  


## 🧠 Features
- 🌿 Detects and classifies plants from a dataset or user input.  
- 📊 Supports multiple algorithms like Decision Tree, Random Forest, and CNN (if image-based).  
- 🧾 Displays accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.  
- 📈 Visualization of training and testing results.
